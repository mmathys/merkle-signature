# Merkle Signing

Basic implementation of the merkle signing algorithm. It supports:

- Creation of a merkle tree (arbitrary length)
- Merkle tree path generation
- Merkle tree path verification (see `VerifyPath`)

The complete implementation of merkle signing requires a valid signature of the merkle root (see ACFTS repo).
